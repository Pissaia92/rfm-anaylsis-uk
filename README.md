# Customer Segmentation Dashboard with RFM Analysis

A clean, interactive dashboard built to segment e-commerce customers based on purchasing behavior using the **RFM model** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary). The goal: turn raw transaction data into actionable insights.

All analysis was done in Python with Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit — from data cleaning to visualization.

## 📊 What It Does

- Segments customers into key groups: **VIP, Loyal, At Risk, Inactive**
- Visualizes revenue distribution and customer engagement
- Highlights top 10 customers and retention opportunities
- Quantifies potential recovery from at-risk clients
- Runs on any device — no setup needed

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **RFM Scoring**: Each customer gets a score (1–5) for:
   - **Recency**: Days since last purchase
   - **Frequency**: Number of orders
   - **Monetary**: Total spent in GBP (£)
   - 
2. **Segmentation**: Scores are combined to define strategic segments.

3. **Dashboard**: Interactive charts show key metrics, trends, and insights — filter by country or segment.
   
   🚀 Why This Stands Out
Not just a chart dump — every visual answers a business question.
Insights over metrics : Focus on retention ROI, revenue concentration, and risk.
Honest about limitations : Dataset is limited (12 months, UK-only), and that’s acknowledged.
Ready for real-world use — could support marketing or CRM decisions.
